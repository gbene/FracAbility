"""
FracAbility has different types of data that needs to be represented in different ways. In the Plotters module
different class adapters are proposed to plot the data. It is possible to plot:


Fracture Network (entity):


1. The geopandas dataframe -> matplotlib:
    + Fractures:
        + Rose plot
        + Backbone(s) -> Different colors if multiple backbones are present
    + Boundary
    + Nodes:
        + Different colors and shapes depending on the node type

2. The VTK entities -> pyvista:
    + Fractures:
        + Backbone(s) -> Different colors if multiple backbones are present
    + Boundary
    + Nodes:
        + Different colors depending on the node type

3. The topology data -> matplotlib:
    + I,Y,X node proportions in a ternary plot

Fracture network (statistics):

1. The statistics -> matplotlib:

    + Single distribution plot (each alone or together):
        + pdf
        + cdf
        + sf
        + summary table

    + Multiple distribution plot:
        + cdf vs ecdf
        + pdf vs histograms
        + P-P and Q-Q plot?
