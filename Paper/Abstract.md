Fracture networks are essential for the analysis and modelling of mechanical and hydraulic properties of rock masses. Research or exploitation of water, natural gas and petroleum reservoirs, all rely heavily on creating fracture models to understand the spatial distribution of fractures and their properties in 3D space. Recently, the use of Digital Outcrop Models (DOMs) overcame the limitations of the classic field survey providing a solid framework for the collection of large and quantitative datasets from which different properties can be extracted. Of particular interest are the topology and length distribution parameters, essential in building a fracture network. 
The calculation of the latter can be challenging because the intrinsic complex nature of exposed rock pavement can introduce bias in the estimation of the population parameters. The censoring effect caused by areas covered by rock debree, vegetation or simply the outcrops' outer boundaries can lead to an underestimation of the mean and variance of the population. We propose FracAbility, a new python toolbox that provides methods for investigating both topology and fracture lengths distributions, with a particular focus to correct the latter for right-censoring bias using survival analysis techniques. By using the recently implemented survival analysis techniques in the scipy package it is possible to efficiently fit a distribution while considering for censored data, correcting the right-censoring bias for the estimating the parameters. 

The modular nature of this python library can lead to rapid analysis of input datasets structured in different ways. Being a stand-alone package FracAbility can be used in different applications such as scripts, jupyter notebooks or used directly in software with python such as QGIS or ArcGIS.
