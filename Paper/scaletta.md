## Introduction



1. Objectives of the package
2. Fracture networks in brief:
	+ What is a fn
	+ Parts of a fn (fn = bounds+fracture/fracture sets+nodes)
	+ Which stats can be calculated -> focus on length and censoring


## Package overview

1. Main package parts i.e. workflow
	+ Geopandas backend database	
	+ Entities (brief)

2. Operations

	+ Geometric operations (brief) 
	+ Topological operations (brief)
	+ Statistical operations

3. Plotting (brief)


## Case studies

1. Execution times(?)
2. Effects of censoring
3. Fracture set analysis
4. Y nodes distribution


## Conclusions
