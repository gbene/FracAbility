Tutorials
===================

We provide two different sets of examples, a basic and an advanced set. In both cases there are a couple of jupyter notebooks
used to showcase the capabilities of FracAbility. Each notebook can be downloaded directly from the page and used.
If you are using a conda environment remember to activate it before launching jupyter.

.. note::
    Some plots will be shown directly in the tutorial page while others (especially the VTK ones) are left out on purpose
    (because as of now they do not render properly on the notebooks). It is encouraged to download the different notebooks and to try them locally.
