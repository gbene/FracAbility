**FracAbility** is a Python toolbox that can be used to objectively analyze fracture networks. This package provides tools to define the topology of fracture networks and to statistaclly analyze fracture length distributions taking into consideration right censoring effects (![survial analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis)). 

The name Frac**Ability** recalls the incredible ![reliability](https://github.com/MatthewReid854/reliability/tree/master) library that inspired the creation of this project. 


# Key features

1. Shapefiles importing support
2. Rapid topology analysis and identification of I,Y,X and U nodes
3. Ternary node plot for network classification
4. All of the statistical tools inherited from the ![reliability](https://github.com/MatthewReid854/reliability/tree/master) project  

# Installation

We are planning to make this package available using pip.
